Molecular subtyping has transformed precision oncology by stratifying patients into biologically and clinically meaningful groups that inform prognosis and guide therapy \citep{pareja2016triple, dienstmann2018molecular, zhou2021clinical, seiler2017impact, prat2015clinical}. Subtyping relies on the identification of robust biological signals such as transcriptomic programs. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) comprises diverse malignant, stromal, immune, and endothelial populations, and the resulting mixture of signals complicates the extraction of tumor-intrinsic programs. Current pipelines therefore depend on deconvolution of bulk transcriptomic data or single-cell analysis to uncover underlying cell populations and their associated signatures, which are then evaluated for prognostic or therapeutic relevance.

Separating discovery from clinical validation risks overfitting and limits the biological and clinical generalizability of the resulting programs. Derived signatures may capture dataset-specific variation rather than reproducible biology \citep{Ou2021, Planey2016}, and even reproducible cell states do not necessarily align with the molecular programs most relevant for survival or treatment response \citep{Prat2014, ellrott2025classification}. These challenges motivate integrative approaches that uncover biologically coherent programs while directly incorporating patient outcomes to ensure clinical relevance.

Integrating survival information directly into discovery remains difficult. Single-cell transcriptomic data provide rich cellular resolution but are typically too small to support robust survival analysis. Bulk transcriptomic cohorts paired with clinical annotations are well-powered for outcome modeling \citep{tomczak2015review, zhang2019international}, yet require deconvolution to separate overlapping cellular signals. Reference-based methods rely on predefined signatures and therefore cannot discover novel programs \citep{nguyen2024fourteen}.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used in cancer genomics because its nonnegativity constraints yield biologically interpretable, additive transcriptional programs \citep{lee1999learning, Bailey2016, moffitt2015virtual, peng2019novo}. While supervised extensions exist, most address regression or classification rather than time-to-event outcomes. Two recent studies incorporate survival information directly into NMF \citep{le2025survnmf, huang2020low}, but both link the survival objective to the sample-level loadings rather than the gene-level programs. This choice facilitates prediction but limits the ability to reconstruct or refine the molecular programs themselves, which is an essential requirement for biological interpretation and subtype discovery. Moreover, neither paper offers principled strategies for hyperparameter selection or model evaluation, and convergence properties are only minimally explored. As both manuscripts remain unpublished and unreviewed, their methodological robustness and reproducibility have not yet been established. Together, these gaps highlight the need for rigorously formulated survival-aware factorization methods that jointly estimate interpretable molecular programs and their prognostic structure.

Here we present DeSurv, a survival-supervised deconvolution framework that integrates NMF with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Unlike unsupervised approaches that assess survival associations only post hoc, and unlike existing supervised NMF methods that attach survival information to the subject-specific factor loadings, DeSurv incorporates survival directly into the gene signature matrix. This formulation ensures that the discovered transcriptional programs are both biologically interpretable and intrinsically aligned with patient outcomes. To promote stability and reproducibility, DeSurv performs automatic parameter selection via Bayesian optimization, addressing the longstanding challenge of rank determination in matrix factorization.

By coupling latent program discovery with direct survival supervision, DeSurv provides a unified methodological framework for resolving tumor–microenvironment interactions and aligning molecular heterogeneity with clinical outcomes. This approach advances the statistical foundations of deconvolution while offering actionable biological insights for translational cancer research.
