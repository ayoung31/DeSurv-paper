Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers, with a five-year survival rate below 12% and few effective therapies. Despite its histologic uniformity, PDAC exhibits striking molecular heterogeneity that drives variability in patient outcomes and treatment response. Large-scale transcriptomic studies have revealed reproducible tumor-intrinsic subtypes—most notably the classical and basal-like (or squamous) lineages—that differ in differentiation state, prognosis, and sensitivity to chemotherapy [Collisson et al., 2011; Moffitt et al., 2015; Bailey et al., 2016; Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020]. However, these classifications capture only part of the biological complexity. PDAC tumors are profoundly desmoplastic, with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and endothelial populations comprising the majority of the tumor mass. The stromal compartment itself is highly heterogeneous, encompassing inflammatory (iCAF), myofibroblastic (myCAF), and antigen-presenting (apCAF) fibroblast subtypes that have opposing effects on tumor progression and immune modulation [Öhlund et al., 2017; Elyada et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2024]. These interacting tumor and stromal components produce deeply entangled gene-expression profiles that obscure the programs most relevant to disease progression.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our understanding of this complexity by resolving transcriptional programs within malignant, stromal, and immune populations at cellular resolution. These studies have identified discrete PDAC cell states, characterized CAF diversity, and revealed cross-compartmental signaling networks that shape tumor behavior [Elyada et al., 2019; Steele et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2024]. Yet, despite their biological richness, single-cell datasets remain limited by small cohort sizes, high technical noise, and a lack of long-term clinical follow-up. As a result, scRNA-seq studies cannot yet establish robust links between cellular programs and patient outcomes. In contrast, large bulk transcriptomic cohorts provide well-annotated clinical data, including overall survival, but lack cellular resolution. Bridging these two modalities—by extracting interpretable, prognostic molecular programs from bulk data—remains a major challenge in translational oncology.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) provides a powerful framework for decomposing bulk transcriptomes into additive, biologically interpretable gene-expression programs [Lee & Seung, 1999; Brunet et al., 2004]. In PDAC, NMF has been instrumental in identifying both epithelial subtypes and stromal activation states, including the “activated” and “normal” stroma signatures that reflect CAF heterogeneity [Moffitt et al., 2015; Puleo et al., 2018]. However, standard NMF is unsupervised—it seeks to explain variance in gene expression rather than variance in patient outcomes. Consequently, the resulting factors may capture dominant but non-prognostic sources of variation such as tumor purity, stromal content, or batch effects [Aran et al., 2017; Thorsson et al., 2018]. This disconnect limits the ability of current subtyping approaches to reveal the transcriptional programs that truly drive PDAC progression.

To overcome these limitations, we developed DeSurv, a survival-driven deconvolution framework that integrates nonnegative matrix factorization with the Cox proportional hazards model [Cox, 1972]. DeSurv incorporates survival information directly into the factorization process, learning latent transcriptional programs that are both biologically interpretable and prognostic. When applied to large PDAC cohorts, DeSurv identifies tumor- and stroma-derived factors associated with survival, providing an interpretable link between the cellular programs observed in single-cell studies and the clinical outcomes measured in bulk patient data. In doing so, DeSurv offers a generalizable framework for outcome-driven molecular subtyping that bridges mechanistic insight and clinical relevance in pancreatic cancer.
