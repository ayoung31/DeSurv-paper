Molecular subtyping has become a cornerstone of precision oncology, enabling the stratification of cancer patients based on distinct gene expression patterns. This stratification informs prognosis, guides therapeutic decisions, and enhances our understanding of tumor biology. 

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was originally developed by Lee and Seung to decompose images into recognizable features.  As opposed to other matrix factorization methods, the nonnegativity constraint of NMF produces an additive parts-based representation of the data. Therefore the interpretation of the factors is intuitive and attractive to scientists who seek to understand underlying biological structures. For this reason, NMF has been widely adopted in bioinformatics applications for the deconvolution of gene expression data, especially in cancer subtyping, where the tumor microenvironment contains diverse cell types.

There have been many extensions of NMF including supervised variations that incorporate label information to obtain discriminative features. These include supervised NMF approaches that directly embed class labels into the factorization process, semi-supervised NMF that leverages both labeled and unlabeled samples, graph-regularized NMF that preserves local label-driven similarity structure, and discriminant NMF formulations that introduce Fisher’s discriminant or margin-based criteria. More recently, task-specific variants have been developed that couple NMF with predictive models such as logistic regression and support vector machines to identify features that are not only low-rank but also predictive of outcomes.

Patient survival outcomes are the gold standard in oncology, and an increasing number of large-scale datasets now include both gene expression and overall survival (OS) information. Unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely applied in this setting to uncover latent molecular subtypes, which are then retrospectively assessed for survival differences. For example, NMF has been used to identify transcriptional subgroups of glioblastoma that align with classical, mesenchymal, and proneural lineages, breast cancer intrinsic subtypes that stratify response to therapy, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subtypes associated with stromal and tumor subtypes. While these analyses have yielded important biological insights, they follow a two-step paradigm: first, factorize expression to define subtypes, and only then examine differences in OS across the inferred groups. This strategy risks identifying factors that capture dominant but non-prognostic sources of variation—such as cell-of-origin, tumor purity, or technical batch effects—while missing subtler components that are more directly tied to patient outcomes.

To address these limitations, we developed deSurv, a Survival-driven Deconvolution framework that integrates gene expression data with patient survival outcomes to uncover cell-type-enriched gene signatures with prognostic relevance. By aligning molecular signals with clinical endpoints, deSurv provides a more targeted and interpretable approach to gene signature discovery. DeSurv also provides methodology to choose the number of latent factors, Applying this method to diverse cancer cohorts, we identify novel prognostic markers  offering new insights into the cellular basis of patient outcomes and revealing candidates for biomarker development or therapeutic intervention.

In oncology, the gold standard of patient outcomes is Overall Survival (OS). Studies across cancer types have used NMF to identify subtype specific tumor subtypes. For example, in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), there were several studies that used NMF for tumor subtype discovery (cite moffitt, collisson, and bailey). However, each of these studies found varying numbers and identities of subtypes. Downstream analyses found that each subtype schema varied in clinical relevance and cross-study reproducibility (cite purist).



Many factors contribute to XXX across studies despite the use of similar methodology. Factors include xxxx, as well as limitations with NMF itself. NMF is sensitive to initialization and can overfit to noise or artifacts of the data. Additionally, selection of the factorization rank is a nontrivial issue that relies on heuristic metrics such as reconstruction error, cophenetic coefficient, residual sum of squares, and silhouette widths. Finally, NMF is an unsupervised method that relies on downstream confirmation of the clinical usefulness of the solution.

Many semi-supervised NMF methods have been proposed with binary or continuous outcomes (much to cite here). However, semi-supervised NMF with a survival outcome is underexplored.

Some of these methods have even been applied to cell-type deconvolution (I think there may be 1-2 papers to cite here). However, these applications focus on cell-type labels, rather than patient outcomes. The gold standard of patient outcomes in oncology is overall survival (OS).
