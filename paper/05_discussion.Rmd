We present DeSurv, a survival-driven deconvolution framework that integrates nonnegative matrix factorization with Cox proportional hazards modeling to uncover latent gene-expression programs associated with patient outcomes. By coupling matrix decomposition with direct survival supervision, DeSurv targets prognostic structure during discovery rather than only in post hoc evaluation, and its Bayesian optimization strategy addresses the ambiguity of rank selection in standard NMF.

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), survival supervision reorganized variance-dominant structure into factors more aligned with outcome. Compared with standard NMF, DeSurv suppressed exocrine- and composition-driven signals that explained substantial expression variance but contributed little to survival, and instead concentrated survival signal into a smaller set of factors. In simulations with known lethal programs, DeSurv more reliably recovered the true rank and improved both concordance and precision of prognostic gene signatures, indicating that outcome-guided learning can sharpen factor interpretability without sacrificing reconstruction.

The learned factors generalized beyond the training data. Across independent PDAC cohorts, the most prognostic DeSurv factor showed consistent hazard ratios and clearer survival separation than the corresponding NMF factor, indicating that the survival-aligned programs transfer across datasets. In bladder cancer, DeSurv again separated variance-dominant from survival-relevant structure, and a PDAC-trained factor retained prognostic signal when projected into bladder samples. Together, these results support DeSurv as a general framework for learning interpretable, outcome-aligned programs in heterogeneous tumors. Future work will test extensions to additional omics layers, alternative outcome models, and larger multi-cohort benchmarks to clarify when outcome supervision offers the greatest benefit.
