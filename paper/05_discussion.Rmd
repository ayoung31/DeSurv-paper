Single-cell RNA sequencing has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of stromal heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), leading to the identification of distinct fibroblast populations such as the inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) (Elyada et al., 2019), and more recently the proliferative CAF (proCAF) and resting CAF (restCAF) states (Bernard et al., 2022). These single-cell frameworks have illuminated the cellular diversity of the PDAC microenvironment, yet they are typically derived from cohorts of <50 patients and lack survival follow-up. Consequently, while they capture cell-level biology with high fidelity, they do not directly establish which stromal states are most consequential for patient outcomes.

By integrating survival information directly into bulk deconvolution, DeSurv provides a complementary perspective. When applied to bulk transcriptomes from large PDAC cohorts, DeSurv recovered latent programs that map onto known single-cell CAF states—yet with the critical distinction that these programs were selected for prognostic relevance. Clustering patients by their DeSurv-derived signatures revealed three major subgroups: Basal + proCAF, Classical + restCAF, and Classical + proCAF. The corresponding heatmap patterns indicate that tumors predominantly exhibit either a stromal-dominant proCAF signal, an epithelial-dominant classical signal, or a hybrid combination of both. These axes of variation were not imposed a priori but emerged from the joint optimization of expression reconstruction and survival likelihood, underscoring that patient outcome acts as a powerful regularizer for biologically meaningful structure.

Incorporating survival into the deconvolution process yielded two key advances. First, it prioritized among the myriad transcriptional programs those that are clinically actionable—in this case, emphasizing that proCAF activity, whether alone or co-occurring with classical epithelial differentiation, consistently portends poorer survival. Second, it uncovered intermediate, mixed phenotypes at the tumor level, exemplified by the Classical + proCAF group. Such coexistence of epithelial and activated-stromal programs suggests that PDAC tumors do not simply toggle between discrete cell states, but instead occupy continuous ecological gradients shaped by epithelial–stromal cross-talk. These hybrid patterns are rarely captured by single-cell analyses, which focus on individual cells rather than population-level mixtures.

From a translational standpoint, survival-guided bulk deconvolution extends the reach of single-cell discoveries into the clinically annotated domain. Whereas single-cell atlases provide mechanistic insight into CAF differentiation, DeSurv quantifies how these programs manifest across hundreds of patients and stratify outcomes. The resulting factors are directly portable to external datasets and can be evaluated as prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic response correlates. In this way, DeSurv bridges the gap between molecular granularity and clinical scale—transforming single-cell–derived biology into patient-level prognostic models.
