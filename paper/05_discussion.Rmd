We present DeSurv, a survival-driven deconvolution framework that integrates nonnegative matrix factorization with Cox proportional hazards modeling to uncover latent gene-expression programs associated with patient outcomes. By coupling unsupervised matrix decomposition with direct survival supervision, DeSurv bridges the gap between descriptive molecular subtyping and prognostic modeling. Unlike conventional NMF, which identifies factors that explain transcriptional variance without regard to clinical relevance, DeSurv simultaneously optimizes reconstruction fidelity and survival discrimination, yielding interpretable gene programs that are both biologically coherent and clinically informative.

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DeSurv identified three major transcriptional programs corresponding to immune/iCAF, normal/exocrine, and basal-like factors. The immune/iCAF factor was associated with prolonged survival and enriched for inflammatory and immune-response pathways, consistent with prior evidence linking tumor-infiltrating immune and inflammatory fibroblast populations to improved outcomes. In contrast, the basal-like factor was strongly associated with poor survival and enriched for epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell-cycle programs characteristic of aggressive tumor phenotypes. The normal/exocrine factor, while not prognostic, captured background pancreatic tissue signal and contributed to accurate reconstruction, demonstrating that DeSurv can disentangle technical and biological sources of variation while preserving those necessary for modeling.

Importantly, DeSurv outperformed unsupervised NMF in cross-validated concordance index, achieving higher predictive accuracy with fewer factors. This suggests that explicitly incorporating survival information regularizes the factorization, producing a more parsimonious representation that focuses on biologically and clinically relevant variation. Moreover, when applied to independent PDAC cohorts—including Dijk, PACA-AU, Moffitt, and Puleo—DeSurv-derived gene signatures stratified patients into three reproducible clusters with clear prognostic differences. These clusters aligned strongly with existing PurIST and DeCAF classifiers, recapitulating the interplay between tumor-intrinsic (Basal versus Classical) and stromal (proCAF versus restCAF/iCAF) subtypes. Notably, survival prediction appeared to depend on the presence or absence of basal and immune/iCAF programs rather than binary subtype identities, indicating that the co-activation or suppression of these programs better captures the biological continuum of PDAC progression.

Beyond PDAC, DeSurv provides a generalizable framework for discovering prognostic transcriptional programs across complex cancers where tumor and stromal signals are interwoven. By integrating survival modeling into matrix factorization, it unifies molecular deconvolution and outcome prediction within a single, interpretable model. This approach complements both single-cell–based tumor–stroma characterization and bulk expression subtyping, offering a scalable route to translate transcriptomic heterogeneity into clinically actionable prognostic insight. Future work will extend DeSurv to multi-omic data and time-varying outcomes, further enhancing its ability to resolve dynamic tumor–microenvironment interactions that shape disease progression and therapy response.
