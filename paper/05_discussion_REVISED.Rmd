We have shown that incorporating survival information during NMF-based deconvolution reorganizes the learned factor structure, concentrating prognostic signal into fewer, more interpretable gene programs while suppressing variance-dominant but outcome-neutral structure. This reorganization produces a more parsimonious representation of prognostically relevant biology: in PDAC, DeSurv achieved with three factors the same cross-validated concordance that standard NMF required seven to eleven factors to match, and even at each method's unrestricted optimum, DeSurv attained a higher concordance with fewer factors. The advantage is most pronounced at low factorization ranks, where standard NMF allocates its limited representational capacity to variance-dominant signals such as exocrine content, leaving little room for prognostic programs to emerge as distinct factors; survival supervision corrects this allocation, enabling recovery of basal-like and microenvironmental programs even at $k = 3$. In simulations, DeSurv recovered the true factorization rank and the identity of prognostic programs more reliably than standard NMF, with the largest advantage occurring when prognostic programs explained modest variance relative to outcome-neutral signals. In PDAC, DeSurv isolated tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental programs with clear survival associations, and these factors generalized across independent PDAC cohorts. For the dominant DeSurv program, prognostic signal transferred to bladder cancer, supporting the hypothesis that outcome-guided learning captures biology that generalizes more readily than variance-driven structure.

In PDAC, DeSurv recapitulated known tumor and microenvironmental programs, including the basal-like/classical distinction and activated versus normal stromal states. The methodological contribution lies not in the identity of these programs---which have been established through virtual microdissection [@moffitt2015virtual], experimental microdissection [@Maurer2019], and unsupervised deconvolution [@peng2019novo]---but in how they are recovered. DeSurv discovers these programs de novo, without requiring pre-specified signatures or post hoc filtering, and directly quantifies their survival associations during the factorization. The resulting factors align with the consensus that has emerged from over a decade of PDAC subtyping efforts [@collisson2011subtypes; @moffitt2015virtual; @Bailey2016; @collisson2019molecular], but are identified through a single optimization rather than iterative retrospective evaluation. The cross-cancer transfer result, in which a PDAC-trained factor stratified bladder cancer survival, is consistent with prior evidence that basal-like transcriptional programs are shared across epithelial cancers [@damrauer2014intrinsic; @Hoadley2018] and suggests that survival supervision captures this shared biology more directly than variance-driven approaches.

The semi-supervised design of DeSurv reflects a deliberate balance between biological completeness and clinical relevance. The reconstruction term (weight $1-\alpha$) penalizes deviation from the observed expression data; the survival term (weight $\alpha$) directs gene programs toward outcome-relevant structure. This balance interacts with rank selection: survival supervision enables parsimonious factorizations by concentrating prognostic signal into fewer factors, so that the one-standard-error rule applied to cross-validated concordance selects smaller ranks than would be chosen by unsupervised criteria or by optimizing concordance without supervision. In PDAC, the cross-validated concordance surface was relatively flat across $k = 3$--12 for DeSurv, indicating that three supervised factors captured nearly as much prognostic information as twelve; for standard NMF, concordance increased steadily from $k = 2$ through $k = 7$--11, reflecting the need for additional factors to distribute prognostic signal that supervision would have concentrated. Our simulations provide further guidance on when this tradeoff is most beneficial: DeSurv's advantage is greatest when prognostic programs explain modest variance relative to outcome-neutral signals and vanishes under null conditions where no survival signal exists. DeSurv is therefore not intended to replace unsupervised NMF in all settings. When the goal is exploratory discovery without clinical endpoints, when survival data is sparse or unreliable, or when the application requires comprehensive biological characterization rather than prognostic stratification, unsupervised methods remain appropriate. The $\alpha$ parameter, tuned via Bayesian optimization, lets the data determine the appropriate balance for a given cancer type and cohort size, and the $\alpha = 0$ endpoint recovers standard NMF as a special case.

Several limitations should be noted. First, DeSurv assumes Cox proportional hazards, which may not hold in settings where treatment effects are delayed or non-proportional, such as immunotherapy response; extensions to more flexible survival models (e.g., accelerated failure time models or neural network-based hazard functions) are a natural direction. Second, the computational cost of Bayesian optimization over cross-validated concordance exceeds that of standard NMF and may limit scalability to very large cohorts or rapid iterative analyses; however, hyperparameter selection is performed once per dataset and the final model can then be applied to arbitrarily many validation cohorts by projection. Third, while the cross-cancer transfer result is encouraging, we tested only one transfer pair (PDAC to bladder), and broader benchmarking across cancer types is needed to establish generality. Fourth, DeSurv's convergence guarantee (SI Appendix) applies to an idealized algorithm; the implementation includes practical modifications (backtracking, gradient clamping) that depart from the theoretical analysis, though empirically these do not affect convergence behavior. Fifth, the supervised factorization is optimized with respect to a specific clinical endpoint, and the resulting molecular programs may differ under alternative outcome definitions (e.g., progression-free vs. overall survival). Moreover, because supervision incorporates observed survival, which reflects both tumor biology and treatment received, the learned factors may implicitly encode treatment-response associations present in the training cohort. The Cox component can incorporate additional clinical covariates to adjust for known confounders during optimization, partially mitigating this concern, though residual confounding from unmeasured factors remains possible. This limits transportability to settings with substantially different treatment landscapes and means the biological interpretation of supervised factors should be understood as conditional on the therapeutic context in which they were derived. Finally, as with any supervised method, DeSurv's value depends on the quality of the outcome data: heavily censored, short follow-up, or misannotated survival information will degrade the learned programs. The nested cross-validation framework mitigates overfitting to training labels, but cannot compensate for systematic outcome misspecification.

More broadly, the principle instantiated by DeSurv---that outcome-guided dimensionality reduction targets different subspaces than variance-driven reduction---extends beyond cancer genomics. Sufficient dimension reduction theory [@cook2007fisher] and the information bottleneck framework [@tishby1999information] both predict that supervised compression retains outcome-relevant structure while discarding nuisance variation. DeSurv realizes this principle within the specific constraints of NMF deconvolution, where nonnegativity preserves biological interpretability and the factorization structure enables single-sample scoring. The success of this approach in PDAC and bladder cancer suggests that analogous frameworks may be valuable in other settings where high-dimensional measurements contain both signal and nuisance variation---including multi-omics integration, spatial transcriptomics, and electronic health records. Extending DeSurv to these domains, and to alternative outcome models beyond Cox regression, is a natural next step. As single-cell cohorts with clinical annotation grow in size, direct survival modeling at cellular resolution may complement deconvolution-based approaches, though the cohort sizes required for stable survival analysis remain available primarily in bulk expression data.
