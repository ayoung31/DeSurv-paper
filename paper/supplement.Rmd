## The NMF–Cox model shows consistent convergence and stability across restarts

Across datasets and initialization schemes, the NMF–Cox algorithm consistently converged to numerically stable solutions within the designated iteration budget. Warm-start strategies, in which solutions at $\alpha=0$ initialized supervised runs, substantially reduced variability across restarts and improved reproducibility. Figure \@ref(fig:fig-converge) shows representative loss trajectories demonstrating monotone decreases until convergence across restarts. Compared with naïve random initialization, warm-starts produced tighter distributions of cross-validated C-index and partial likelihood, confirming stability of the optimization procedure.
