Molecular subtyping has become a cornerstone of precision oncology, enabling the stratification of cancer patients based on distinct gene expression patterns. This stratification informs prognosis, guides therapeutic decisions, and enhances our understanding of tumor biology. 

The discovery of subtypes has traditionally been done using unsupervised learning methods to find expression patterns that can represent cell types or states. Particularly, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a widely used tool, since the nonnegativity increases interpretability of the latent expression patterns. For example, in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), there were several studies that used NMF for tumor subtype discovery (cite moffitt, collisson, and bailey). However, each of these studies found varying numbers and identities of subtypes. Downstream analyses found that each subtype schema varied in clinical relevance and cross-study reproducibility (cite purist).


Many factors contribute to XXX across studies despite the use of similar methodology. Factors include xxxx, as well as limitations with NMF itself. NMF is sensitive to initialization and can overfit to noise or artifacts of the data. Additionally, selection of the factorization rank is a nontrivial issue that relies on heuristic metrics such as reconstruction error, cophenetic coefficient, residual sum of squares, and silhouette widths. Finally, NMF is an unsupervised method that relies on downstream confirmation of the clinical usefulness of the solution.

Many semi-supervised NMF methods have been proposed with binary or continuous outcomes (much to cite here). However, semi-supervised NMF with a survival outcome is underexplored.

Some of these methods have even been applied to cell-type deconvolution (I think there may be 1-2 papers to cite here). However, these applications focus on cell-type labels, rather than patient outcomes. The gold standard of patient outcomes in oncology is overall survival (OS).

To address these issues, we developed deSurv, a Survival-driven Deconvolution framework that integrates gene expression data with patient survival outcomes to uncover cell-type-enriched gene signatures with prognostic relevance. By aligning molecular signals with clinical endpoints, deSurv provides a more targeted and interpretable approach to gene signature discovery. Applying this method to diverse cancer cohorts, we identify novel prognostic markers  offering new insights into the cellular basis of patient outcomes and revealing candidates for biomarker development or therapeutic intervention.
