Molecular subtyping has become a cornerstone of precision oncology, enabling the stratification of cancer patients based on distinct gene expression patterns [Kandoth et al., 2013; Hoadley et al., 2018]. This stratification informs prognosis, guides therapeutic decisions, and enhances our understanding of tumor biology.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), first introduced by Lee and Seung for image decomposition [Lee & Seung, 1999], has become a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. Unlike other matrix factorization approaches, the nonnegativity constraint in NMF yields an additive, parts-based representation that facilitates interpretability of latent factors. These properties have motivated extensive methodological development, leading to extensions that incorporate domain knowledge, structural constraints, or supervision. Examples include sparsity-regularized formulations [Hoyer, 2004], graph-regularized NMF [Cai et al., 2008], and more recent supervised formulations such as NMFProfiler for multi-omics integration and clinical stratification [Mercadié et al., 2025], as well as Bayesian multi-study NMF frameworks for mutational signatures [Grabski et al., 2025]. Collectively, these frameworks highlight the flexibility of NMF as a foundation for problem-specific decompositions.

High-throughput cancer transcriptomic datasets pose unique challenges for matrix factorization: they are high-dimensional, reflect mixtures of tumor and stromal populations, and are increasingly paired with censored survival outcomes. Standard applications of NMF in this domain typically follow a two-stage procedure—first identifying latent factors in an unsupervised manner, then testing their association with overall survival [Brunet et al., 2004; Bailey et al., 2016]. This retrospective strategy can uncover biologically meaningful patterns, but it does not optimize the decomposition with respect to patient outcomes, often yielding factors dominated by non-prognostic variation such as tumor purity, stromal admixture, or batch effects [Aran et al., 2017; Thorsson et al., 2018]. Although supervised and discriminant variants of NMF have been explored [Tran et al., 2024], and some recent works have coupled factorization with survival analysis (e.g., Learning Individual Survival Models from PanCancer Whole Transcriptomes [Kumar et al., 2023]; CoxNTF [Fogel et al., 2025]), these approaches either treat survival as a downstream predictor or rely on tensor factorizations not tailored to high-dimensional gene expression data.

To address this gap, we introduce deSurv, a survival-driven deconvolution framework that integrates NMF with the Cox proportional hazards model [Cox, 1972]. deSurv directly incorporates survival information during factorization, producing interpretable, prognostic components while providing principled model selection criteria and regularization for high-dimensional stability [Tibshirani, 1997]. Implemented in a scalable pipeline for large cohorts, deSurv improves survival prediction relative to conventional unsupervised NMF while retaining interpretability. These results establish deSurv as a general framework for outcome-driven molecular subtyping across cancer types.
