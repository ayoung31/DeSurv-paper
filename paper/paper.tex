\begin{abstract}
Molecular subtyping in cancer is an ongoing problem that relies on the
identification of robust and replicable gene signatures. While
transcriptomic profiling has revealed recurrent gene expression patterns
in various types of cancer, the prognostic value of these signatures is
typically evaluated in retrospect. This is due to the reliance on
unsupervised learning methods for identifying cell-type-specific signals
and clustering patients into molecular subtypes. Here we present a
Survival-driven Deconvolution tool (deSurv) that integrates bulk
RNA-sequencing data with patient survival information to identify
cell-type-enriched gene signatures associated with prognosis. Applying
deSurv to various cohorts in pancreatic cancer, we uncover prognostic
and biologically interpretable subtypes that reflect the complex
interactions between stroma, tumor, and immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Our approach highlights the value of using patient
outcomes during gene signature discovery.

Molecular subtyping has transformed precision oncology by stratifying
patients into biologically and clinically meaningful groups that inform
prognosis and guide therapy (1--5). Subtyping relies on the
identification of robust biological signals that define subtypes such as
transcriptomic signatures. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME)
contains mixtures of diverse cell types such as malignant, stromal,
immune, and endothelial cells, and disentangling tumor specific signals
from this mixture can be challenging. As such, subtyping pipelines
typically rely on the deconvolution of bulk transcriptomic data or
single-cell analysis to discover distinct cell types and their
corresponding signatures. Downstream, the signatures are evaluated for
clinical relevance such as overall survival or response to treatment.

Separating discovery from validation can risk overfitting and limits
biological and clinical generalizability. Identified cell types may
capture dataset-specific noise rather than reproducible biological
signals, undermining their utility in downstream analyses or therapeutic
targeting (6, 7). Moreover, even when discovered cell types are
biologically valid and reproducible, they may not correspond to the
cellular programs most relevant for predicting or influencing clinical
outcomes (8, 9). Therefore, there is a clear need for integrative
methods that jointly uncover biologically meaningful programs while
directly incorporating clinical endpoints to ensure prognostic
relevance.

However, integrating patient outcomes into the discovery phase is not
straightforward with current technology and methodology. Single-cell
transcriptomics can resolve programs at the cellular level, but cohort
sizes are often too small to support survival analyses. In contrast,
large bulk transcriptomic cohorts with clinical annotations are
well-suited for outcome modeling (10, 11), yet deconvolution is needed
to disentangle overlapping cellular signals. Reference-based
deconvolution methods focus on estimating cell-type proportions from
predefined signatures, which limits the utility of these methods for
discovery of novel programs (12).

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used in cancer genomics
because its nonnegativity constraints produce biologically
interpretable, additive molecular programs (13--16). Although recent
extensions have incorporated supervision into the factorization, most
target regression or classification rather than time-to-event outcomes.
Two studies have proposed survival-aware NMF formulations (17, 18), but
both integrate the survival objective through the sample-specific
loadings rather than the gene-level programs. This design emphasizes
prediction accuracy but limits the model's ability to restructure or
refine the underlying molecular programs, reducing its value for
biological interpretation and subtype discovery, which are core
objectives in cancer transcriptomics. In addition, neither study
provides a principled approach for hyperparameter selection or model
assessment, and convergence properties are only briefly addressed in one
manuscript. Both works remain unpublished and unreviewed, leaving their
methodological robustness and reproducibility uncertain. These gaps
highlight the need for a rigorously formulated, survival-aware
deconvolution method that jointly estimates interpretable molecular
programs and their prognostic relevance.

Here we present DeSurv, a Survival-supervised Deconvolution framework
that integrates non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with Cox
proportional hazards modelling. In contrast to fully unsupervised
approaches that evaluate survival associations only after the
factorization, and to existing supervised NMF models that link outcomes
to the subject-level factor loadings, DeSurv integrates survival
information directly into the gene signature matrix. This design ensures
that the discovered transcriptional programs are not only biologically
interpretable but also intrinsically aligned with patient outcomes. To
enhance robustness and reproducibility, DeSurv performs automatic
parameter selection via Bayesian optimization, addressing the
quintessential challenge of rank determination in matrix factorization.

By coupling latent program discovery with direct survival supervision,
DeSurv resolves longstanding challenges in disentangling
tumor--microenvironment interactions and aligns molecular heterogeneity
with clinical outcomes. This unified approach represents a
methodological advance in translational cancer genomics and provides a
general framework for deriving actionable insights from high-dimensional
transcriptomic data.

\subsection*{Model Overview}\label{model-overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Model Overview}

We have developed an integrated framework, DeSurv, that couples
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with Cox proportional hazards
regression to identify latent gene-expression programs associated with
patient survival (Figure @ref(fig:fig-schema)). The model takes as input
a bulk expression matrix of \(p\) genes by \(n\) patients
(\(X_{Train}\)) together with corresponding survival times
(\(y_{Train}\)) and censoring indicators (\(\delta_{Train}\)) (Figure
@ref(fig:fig-schema)A).

DeSurv optimizes a joint objective combining the NMF reconstruction loss
and the Cox model's log-partial likelihood, weighted by a supervision
parameter (\(\alpha\)) that determines the relative contribution of each
term (Figure @ref(fig:fig-schema)B): \begin{align}
  (1-\alpha)\ &\mathcal{L}_{NMF}(X_{Train} \approx WH)\nonumber \\ - \alpha\ &\mathcal{L}_{Cox}(X_{Train}^TW\beta,y_{Train},\delta_{Train})
\end{align} When \(\alpha=0\), the method reduces to standard
unsupervised NMF; when \(\alpha>0\), survival information directly
guides the learned factors toward prognostic structure.

Within this framework, the product (\(X_{Train}^TW\)) represents
patient-level factor scores - the inferred burden of each latent program
across subjects. These factor scores serve as covariates in the Cox
model, and their regression coefficients (\(\beta\)) indicate whether
higher activity of a given program corresponds to improved or reduced
survival.

Model training yields gene weights (\(\hat{W}\)), factor loadings
(\(\hat{H}\)), and Cox coefficients (\(\hat{\beta}\)) (Figure
@ref(fig:fig-schema)C), where the inner dimension (\(k\)) specifies the
number of latent factors. Genes with high gene weights in one factor and
low gene weights in all others define the factor-specific signature
genes (Figure @ref(fig:fig-schema)D). By integrating survival
supervision into the factorization, DeSurv not only reconstructs the
underlying expression structure, preserving biologial interpretability,
but also guides latent factors to be prognostically informative.
Subsequent analyses can therefore focus on the survival-associated gene
programs (Figure @ref(fig:fig-schema)E).

\subsection*{\texorpdfstring{Bayesian optimisation selects the DeSurv
hyperparameters (\(k\),
\(\alpha\))}{Bayesian optimisation selects the DeSurv hyperparameters (k, \textbackslash alpha)}}\label{bayesian-optimisation-selects-the-desurv-hyperparameters-k-alpha}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Bayesian optimisation selects the
DeSurv hyperparameters (\(k\), \(\alpha\))}

We now tune DeSurv with Bayesian optimisation (BO) rather than
enumerating a dense cross-validation grid. Each BO evaluation fits the
model for a single combination of \(k\), \(\alpha\), and penalty
weights, measuring the mean validation C-index. A Gaussian-process
surrogate models this surface and proposes new evaluations that balance
exploration and exploitation, allowing the search to concentrate rapidly
on high-performing regions.

Figure @ref(fig:fig-bo) summarises the optimisation run. Panel A reports
the best observed cross-validated C-index at each \(k\) for the
supervised and \(\alpha=0\) searches, with error bars denoting the
cross-validation standard error across folds. The final configuration of
the supervised search converges to \(k=3\) and \(\alpha=0.7\), which
provided the highest cross-validated C-index encountered by BO.

For reference we still report standard NMF heuristics (Panels B-D:
cophenetic, residuals, and silhouette), which historically guide rank
selection when a supervised criterion is unavailable. These diagnostics
disagree on the optimal \(k\), underscoring the benefit of the BO-guided
DeSurv procedure that explicitly maximises prognostic accuracy.

\subsection*{DeSurv captures prognostic gene
signatures}\label{desurv-captures-prognostic-gene-signatures}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{DeSurv captures prognostic gene
signatures}

To isolate how supervision shapes the recovered gene programs, we
highlight the BO-tuned \(\texttt{n\_top}\) simulations in two
contrasting regimes. The R0\_easy setting contains a clear survival
signal, whereas R00\_null contains no prognostic structure by design.
Figure @ref(fig:fig-sim-ntop-scenarios) shows that in R0\_easy, DeSurv
attains higher test C-index and improved precision for lethal genes
relative to the \(\alpha=0\) baseline, indicating that supervision
concentrates the signatures on true survival drivers. In the null
setting, performance compresses toward chance for both methods,
suggesting that DeSurv does not manufacture prognostic structure when
none is present.

\subsection*{DeSurv improves selection of prognostic gene
signatures}\label{desurv-improves-selection-of-prognostic-gene-signatures}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{DeSurv improves selection of
prognostic gene signatures}

To test whether supervision improves the selection of prognostic gene
signatures, we used simulations with known lethal factors and tuned the
number of top genes per factor (\texttt{n\_top}) using BO. We compared
the supervised DeSurv model to the unsupervised \(\alpha=0\) baseline
across simulation regimes. Figure @ref(fig:fig-sim-ntop)A shows the
distribution of test C-index values, while Figure
@ref(fig:fig-sim-ntop)B reports the precision of recovered prognostic
genes (mean across lethal factors). DeSurv consistently yields higher
C-index and improved precision, indicating that survival supervision
helps focus signatures on truly prognostic genes rather than
reconstruction-only structure.

\subsection*{DeSurv provides biologically interpretable gene
signatures}\label{desurv-provides-biologically-interpretable-gene-signatures}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{DeSurv provides biologically
interpretable gene signatures}

For the selected DeSurv model (\(k=3, \alpha=0.7\)), we identified the
top 50 factor-specific genes from each latent factor to characterize
their underlying biological functions. Panels A-C of Figure
@ref(fig:fig-bio) summarize the results of an over-representation
analysis (ORA) performed on these genes. The enrichment profiles reveal
three distinct biological programs. Factor 1 is strongly enriched for
immune-related pathways, including cytokine signaling, T-cell
activation, and interferon response. Factor 2 shows enrichment for genes
associated with normal pancreatic or exocrine function, suggesting that
this component captures residual normal-tissue signal. Factor 3 is
enriched for pathways linked to epithelial--mesenchymal transition, cell
cycle progression, and KRAS signaling---features typically associated
with the Basal-like subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

Survival analysis of the factor signature scores on the training data
demonstrates clear prognostic stratification. High expression of Factor
1 is associated with longer overall survival (HR = 0.37, p \textless{}
2e-16), whereas Factor 3 is linked to significantly shorter survival (HR
= 1.43, p = 2e-4). These trends are consistent with known biology:
immune-infiltrated tumors generally exhibit improved prognosis, while
Basal-like tumors are aggressive and clinically refractory. Factor 2,
corresponding to the normal/exocrine signal, shows no significant
association with survival (HR = 0.99, p = 0.91), indicating that while
this component contributes to reconstructing the expression matrix, it
does not carry prognostic information. This behavior illustrates a key
property of DeSurv---its joint optimization ensures that the latent
factors balance both survival relevance and expression reconstruction,
preserving biologically necessary structure even when not directly
linked to outcome.

Panel D of Figure @ref(fig:fig-bio) further examines the correlation
between DeSurv factors and previously published PDAC gene signatures.
Factor 1 aligns with signatures from classical tumor, iCAF and restCAF
stroma, and immune infiltration, all of which are associated with
favorable prognosis. In contrast, Factor 3 correlates with Basal-like
tumor, proCAF, and activated stromal programs, which are generally
linked to poor outcomes. These overlaps suggest that each factor
represents a composite axis of tumor--stroma-immune interaction,
capturing biologically coherent programs that align with known PDAC
ecosystems but arise de novo from the DeSurv model.

\subsection*{External validation with projected DeSurv factor
scores}\label{external-validation-with-projected-desurv-factor-scores}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{External validation with projected
DeSurv factor scores}

To evaluate the generalizability of DeSurv-derived prognostic
signatures, we projected the DeSurv weights onto multiple independent
PDAC cohorts (Dijk, PACA-AU RNA-seq and microarray, Moffitt, and Puleo).
We selected the two most prognostic factors using
\texttt{select\_desurv\_factors}, rank-transformed expression within
each sample over the union of the selected factor gene lists, and
computed validation scores as \(Z_{val} = X_{val}^T W\) restricted to
the top-gene signatures. This yields continuous factor score vectors for
each cohort without clustering.

Figure @ref(fig:fig-extval)A shows the ranked expression heatmap for the
selected factor gene signatures, annotated with the continuous factor
scores and the PurIST, DeCAF, and dataset labels. Figure
@ref(fig:fig-extval)B plots the top two factor scores for all samples,
colored by PurIST subtype and shaped by DeCAF subtype to show how tumor-
and stroma-associated programs align across cohorts. For survival
assessment, we discretized each factor score within each cohort at its
median and intersected the high/low calls to form four groups;
Kaplan--Meier curves for these groups are shown in Figure
@ref(fig:fig-extval)C. Because DeSurv was trained only on
TCGA-PAAD/CPTAC, these analyses represent an independent validation of
prognostic signal transfer to external datasets.

\subsection*{Bladder cancer analysis}\label{bladder-cancer-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Bladder cancer analysis}

We will report a focused bladder cancer analysis here, including a
dedicated figure. Placeholder text: summary of bladder cohort
preprocessing, DeSurv factor interpretation, and survival stratification

\section*{Discussion}\label{discussion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}

We present DeSurv, a survival-driven deconvolution framework that
integrates nonnegative matrix factorization with Cox proportional
hazards modeling to uncover latent gene-expression programs associated
with patient outcomes. By coupling unsupervised matrix decomposition
with direct survival supervision, DeSurv bridges the gap between
descriptive molecular subtyping and prognostic modeling. Unlike
conventional NMF, which identifies factors that explain transcriptional
variance without regard to clinical relevance, DeSurv simultaneously
optimizes reconstruction fidelity and survival discrimination, yielding
interpretable gene programs that are both biologically coherent and
clinically informative.

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), DeSurv identified three
major transcriptional programs corresponding to immune/iCAF,
normal/exocrine, and basal-like factors. The immune/iCAF factor was
associated with prolonged survival and enriched for inflammatory and
immune-response pathways, consistent with prior evidence linking
tumor-infiltrating immune and inflammatory fibroblast populations to
improved outcomes. In contrast, the basal-like factor was strongly
associated with poor survival and enriched for epithelial--mesenchymal
transition and cell-cycle programs characteristic of aggressive tumor
phenotypes. The normal/exocrine factor, while not prognostic, captured
background pancreatic tissue signal and contributed to accurate
reconstruction, demonstrating that DeSurv can disentangle prognostic
sources of variation while preserving biology.

Importantly, DeSurv outperformed unsupervised NMF in cross-validated
concordance index, achieving higher predictive accuracy with fewer
factors. This suggests that explicitly incorporating survival
information regularizes the factorization, producing a more parsimonious
representation that focuses on biologically and clinically relevant
variation. Moreover, when applied to independent PDAC
cohorts---including Dijk, PACA-AU, Moffitt, and Puleo---DeSurv-derived
gene signatures stratified patients into three reproducible clusters
with clear prognostic differences. These clusters aligned strongly with
existing PurIST and DeCAF classifiers, recapitulating the interplay
between tumor-intrinsic (Basal versus Classical) and stromal (proCAF
versus restCAF/iCAF) subtypes. Notably, survival prediction appeared to
depend on the presence or absence of basal and immune/iCAF programs
rather than binary subtype identities, indicating that the co-activation
or suppression of these programs better captures the biological
continuum of PDAC progression.

Beyond PDAC, DeSurv provides a generalizable framework for discovering
prognostic transcriptional programs across complex cancers where tumor
and stromal signals are interwoven. By integrating survival modeling
into matrix factorization, it unifies molecular deconvolution and
outcome prediction within a single, interpretable model. This approach
complements both single-cell--based tumor--stroma characterization and
bulk expression subtyping, offering a scalable route to translate
transcriptomic heterogeneity into clinically actionable prognostic
insight. Future work will extend DeSurv to multi-omic data and
time-varying outcomes, further enhancing its ability to resolve dynamic
tumor--microenvironment interactions that shape disease progression and
therapy response.

\section*{Materials and methods}\label{materials-and-methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Materials and methods}

\subsection{Problem formulation and
notation}\label{problem-formulation-and-notation}

Let \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}_{\ge 0}\) denote the nonnegative
gene expression matrix. DeSurv approximates \(X \approx WH\), where
\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times k}_{\ge0}\) contains nonnegative gene
programs and \(H \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times n}_{\ge0}\) contains
sample-level activations. Additionally, let
\(y,\ \delta \in \mathbb{R}^n\) represent patient survival times and
censoring indicators, respectively. Survival outcomes are modeled
through a cox proportional hazards model with covariates
\(Z = W^\top X\).

\subsection{The DeSurv Model}\label{the-desurv-model}

DeSurv integrates Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with penalized
Cox regression to identify gene programs associated with patient
survival.

The joint objective is\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:desurv}
\mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta) =
(1-\alpha)\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{NMF}}(W,H)
- \alpha\,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Cox}}(W,\beta),
\end{equation} where \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{NMF}}(W,H)\) is the NMF
reconstruction error and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Cox}}(W,\beta)\) is the
elastic-net penalized partial log-likelihood. Optimization proceeds by
alternating updates for \(H\), \(W\), and \(\beta\), using
multiplicative rules for \(H\) (13), projected gradients for \(W\), and
coordinate descent for \(\beta\). Although non-convex, these updates are
shown to converge to a stationary point under mild conditions (SI
Appendix). Complete derivations and algorithmic details are provided in
the SI Appendix.

\subsection{Hyperparameter selection and
cross-validation}\label{hyperparameter-selection-and-cross-validation}

Hyperparameters \((k,\alpha,\lambda_H,\lambda,\xi)\) were selected by
maximizing the cross-validated C-index using Bayesian optimization. Each
fold was trained using multiple random initializations, and fold-level
performance was defined as the average C-index across initializations.
For stability, we used a consensus-based initialization for the final
model, aggregating multiple DeSurv runs into a gene--gene co-occurrence
matrix and constructing an initialization \(W_0\) from the resulting
clusters (SI Appendix). Before validation, each column of \(W\) was
truncated to its BO-selected number of top genes (details in SI
Appendix), denoted \(\tilde{W}\). External validation was performed by
first projecting new datasets onto the learned programs via
\(Z = \tilde{W}^\top X_{\text{new}}\) and evaluating survival
associations using C-index and log-rank statistics. To evaluate the
quality of the DeSurv derived gene signatures for subtyping, the new
datasets \(X_new\) were clustered on genes in \(\tilde{W}\), and
survival differences were analyzed for the derived clusters. Further
training, validation, and runtime details appear in the SI Appendix.

\subsection{Simulation studies}\label{simulation-studies}

Simulation studies were conducted to assess recovery of prognostic
latent structure and survival prediction. Gene expression data were
generated from a non-negative factor model \(X=WH\), where gene loadings
\(W\) comprised three gene classes: marker genes, background genes, and
noise genes. Marker genes were simulated to load strongly on a single
factor and weakly on others, background genes to load strongly across
all factors, and noise genes to have uniformly low loadings; each class
was generated from a distinct gamma distribution. Sample-level factor
activities \(H\) were generated from a gamma distribution.

Survival times were generated from an exponential proportional hazards
model in which risk depended on marker gene structure through
\(X^T\tilde{W}\), where \(\tilde{W}\) retained marker gene loadings for
their corresponding factors and was zero otherwise; censoring times were
generated independently from an exponential distribution. Each dataset
was analyzed using DeSurv, standard NMF followed by Cox regression on
inferred factors, and penalized Cox regression (CoxNet), with all
methods tuned using the same cross-validated concordance index.
Performance was summarized across repeated simulation replicates.

\subsection{Evaluation metrics}\label{evaluation-metrics}

\subsection{Real-world datasets}\label{real-world-datasets}

We analyzed publicly available RNA-seq and microarray cohorts of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and bladder cancer with
corresponding overall survival outcomes. Gene expression matrices were
converted to TPM, log-transformed, and filtered to remove low-expression
genes. Survival times and censoring indicators were taken from the
associated clinical annotations. Of the seven PDAC cohorts we
considered, two were used for training (TCGA and CPTAC) and the rest
were used for external validation (Dijk, Moffitt, PACA, Puleo). The
bladder cohort was split into training and validation cohorts via a
70/30 split. To harmonize differences in scale across cohorts, filtered
gene expression data was within-subject rank transformed before model
training. More details about the datasets can be found in the SI
Appendix.

\subsection{Model details}

Let \(X \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{p \times n}\) denote the nonnegative
gene expression matrix with \(p\) genes and \(n\) subjects. DeSurv
approximates \(X \approx WH\) with
\(W \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{p \times k}\) and
\(H \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{k \times n}\), and links the shared program
matrix \(W\) to survival via an elastic-net--penalized Cox model.

Let \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n_{\ge 0}\) be the observed survival times,
\(\delta \in \{0,1\}^n\) the event indicators, and
\(Z = X^\top W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}\) the sample-wise program
loadings. We write \(Z_i^\top\) for the \(i\)th row of \(Z\), and
\(n_{\text{event}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i\). For convenience we recall
the DeSurv loss from Equation\textasciitilde{}\ref{eqn:desurv} in the
main text and rewrite it as \begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta) &=\nonumber \\
  &(1-\alpha)\left(\frac{1}{2np}\lVert X - WH \rVert_F^2 + \frac{\lambda_H}{2nk} \lVert H \rVert_F^2\right) \nonumber \\
  -&\alpha \left(\frac{2}{n_{event}}\ell(W,\beta) - \lambda \{ \xi \lVert \beta \rVert_1 + \tfrac{1-\xi}{2} \lVert \beta \rVert_2^2 \} \right) \nonumber
\end{align}

where \(\lVert \cdot \rVert_F\) is the Frobenius norm and
\(\beta \in \mathbb{R}^k\) are the Cox coefficients. The Cox log-partial
likelihood \(\ell(W,\beta)\) is \begin{equation}
\ell(W,\beta)
=
\sum_{i=1}^n
\delta_i
\left[
  Z_i^\top \beta
  -
  \log \left(
    \sum_{j : y_j \ge y_i}
    \exp(Z_j^\top \beta)
  \right)
\right].
\end{equation} Hyperparameters satisfy \(\alpha \in [0,1)\),
\(\lambda_H \ge 0\), \(\lambda \ge 0\), and \(\xi \in [0,1]\). The
constants \(1/(2np)\), \(2/n_{\text{event}}\), and \(1/(2nk)\) are
chosen for numerical convenience and do not affect the minimizer.

\subsubsection{Block coordinate descent scheme}

Algorithm\textasciitilde{}\ref{alg:desurv} summarizes the block
coordinate descent (BCD) scheme used to minimize
\(\mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta)\). At each outer iteration, we update \(H\),
then \(W\), then \(\beta\) while holding the other blocks fixed.

        \EndWhile
        \State \Return $\hat{W} = W^{(t+1)}, \hat{H} = H^{(t+1)}, \hat{\beta}=\beta^{(t+1)}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Update for $H$}

Conditional on \(W\), the loss \(\mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta)\) reduces to a
strictly convex quadratic function of \(H\). We adopt the standard NMF
multiplicative update with \(\ell_2\) penalty: \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Hupdate}
H \leftarrow
\max\!\left(
  H \odot \frac{W^\top X}{
    W^\top W H + \lambda_H H + \varepsilon_H
  },
  \varepsilon_H
\right),
\end{equation} where \(\odot\) denotes elementwise multiplication, all
divisions are elementwise, and \(\varepsilon_H > 0\) is a small floor to
prevent entries from becoming exactly zero. This update is equivalent to
a majorization--minimization step and guarantees a nonincreasing
reconstruction term conditional on \(W\) (19, 20). The
\(\varepsilon_H\)-floor ensures that iterates remain in the interior of
the nonnegative orthant, which simplifies the convergence analysis.

\subsubsection{Update for $W$}

For \(W\), we construct a hybrid multiplicative update that balances the
contributions of the NMF and Cox gradients. Let \[
\nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{NMF}}(W,H)
=
\frac{1}{np}(W H - X)H^\top,
\] and let \[
\nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Cox}}(W,\beta)
=
\frac{2}{n_{event}}\nabla_W \ell(W,\beta).
\] where \(\nabla_W \ell(W,\beta)\) denotes the Cox gradient with
respect to \(W\). A closed-form expression for \(\nabla_W \ell\) is
\begin{equation}
\nabla_W \ell(W,\beta)
=
\sum_{i=1}^n
\delta_i
\left(
  x_i
  -\frac{
      \sum_{j : y_j \ge y_i}
        x_j \exp(x_j^\top W \beta)
    }{
      \sum_{j : y_j \ge y_i}
        \exp(x_j^\top W \beta)
    }
\right)\beta^\top,
\end{equation} where \(x_i\) denotes the \(i\)th column of \(X\).

We define the gradient-balancing factor \begin{equation}
\label{eq:supp-delta}
\delta^{(t)}
=
\frac{
  \left\lVert (1-\alpha) \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{NMF}}(W^{(t)},H^{(t+1)}) \right\rVert_F^2
}{
  \left\lVert \alpha \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{Cox}(W^{(t)},\beta^{(t)}) \right\rVert_F^2
},
\end{equation} and clip \(\delta^{(t)}\) to avoid extreme values:
\(\delta^{(t)} \leftarrow \min(\delta^{(t)}, \delta_{\max})\) with
\(\delta_{\max} = 10^6\) in all experiments.

The multiplicative factor for \(W\) is then \begin{equation}
R^{(t)}
=
\frac{
  \frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} X H^{(t+1)\top}
  +\frac{2\alpha}{n_{\mathrm{event}}}\,\delta^{(t)}\,\nabla_W \ell(W^{(t)},\beta^{(t)})
}{
  \frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} W^{(t)} H^{(t+1)}H^{(t+1)\top}
  +\varepsilon_W
},
\end{equation} and the proposed update is \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:W_update}
W^{(t+1)}
=
\max\!\left(
  W^{(t)} \odot R^{(t)},
  \varepsilon_W
\right),
\end{equation} with a small floor \(\varepsilon_W > 0\). When
\(\alpha=0\), this reduces to the standard multiplicative update for NMF
(19); for \(\alpha>0\), the Cox gradient perturbs the update in a
direction that decreases the supervised loss.

Because the combined multiplicative step does not, by itself, guarantee
a nonincrease in the full loss \(\mathcal{L}\), we embed it in a
backtracking line search.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{$W$ update with backtracking}
\label{alg:backtrack}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Require Value of $W$ and the previous iteration $t$: $W^{(t)}$, the multiplicative update term at the current iteration $R^{(t+1)}$, the max number of backtracking updates $max\_bt$, the backtracking parameter $\rho \subset (0,1)$
        \Ensure $W^{(t+1)}$
        \State $\theta =1$
        \State b = 1
        \State $flag\_accept = FALSE$
        \While{$b \leq max\_bt$}
            \State $W^{(t+1)}_{cand} = W^{(t)} \odot [(1-\theta) + \theta R^{(t+1)}]$
            \State \textbf{(Column normalization)}
            \State \hspace{0.5cm} Compute $D = \mathrm{diag}\!\big(\lVert W^{(t+1)}_{(:,1)cand}\rVert_2,\dots,\lVert W^{(t+1)}_{(:,k)cand}\rVert_2\big)$
            \State \hspace{0.5cm} and set $W^{(t+1)}_{cand} \leftarrow W^{(t+1)}_{cand} D^{-1}$, $H^{(t+1)}_{cand} \leftarrow D H^{(t+1)}$, and $\beta^{(t)}_{cand} \leftarrow D \beta^{(t)}$
            \If{$\mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)}_{cand},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)}) \leq \mathcal{L}(W^{(t)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)})$}
              \State $W^{(t+1)} = W^{(t+1)}_{cand}$
              \State $H^{(t+1)} = H^{(t+1)}_{cand}$
              \State $\beta^{(t)} = \beta^{(t)}_{cand}$
              \State $flag\_accept = TRUE$
              \State break
            \EndIf
            \State $\theta = \theta*\rho$
            \State $b = b + 1$
        \EndWhile
        \If{$flag\_accept = FALSE$}
            \State $W^{(t+1)}=W^{(t)}$
        \EndIf
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The column normalization preserves both \(WH\) and \(W\beta\), and
therefore leaves the loss \(\mathcal{L}\) invariant up to numerical
error. Backtracking guarantees that the accepted \(W\) update does not
increase \(\mathcal{L}\).

\subsubsection{Update for $\beta$}

Conditional on \((W,H)\), the loss in \(\beta\) reduces to a convex
elastic-net--penalized Cox problem: \[
\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^k}
\left\{
  -\frac{2\alpha}{n_{\mathrm{event}}}\,\ell(W,\beta)
  +
  \lambda\left(
    \xi \lVert \beta \rVert_1
    +\frac{1-\xi}{2} \lVert \beta \rVert_2^2
  \right)
\right\}.
\] We solve this subproblem by cyclic coordinate descent following (21).
Writing \(\ell(\beta) = \ell(W,\beta)\) and
\(\tilde{\eta}_i = Z_i^\top \beta\), the update for coordinate \(r\) has
the closed form \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:beta_update}
\hat{\beta}_r
=
\frac{
  S\!\left(
    \dfrac{1}{n}
    \sum_{i=1}^n w(\tilde{\eta})_i
    z_{i,r}
    \left[
      v(\tilde{\eta})_i - \sum_{j \ne r} z_{i,j} \beta_j
    \right],
    \lambda \xi
  \right)
}{
  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n w(\tilde{\eta})_i z_{i,r}^2 + \lambda(1-\xi)
},
\end{equation} where \(S(a,\tau) = \mathrm{sign}(a)\max(|a|-\tau,0)\) is
the soft-thresholding operator, and \(w(\tilde{\eta})\),
\(v(\tilde{\eta})\) are standard local quadratic approximations of the
Cox log-partial likelihood (21). We iterate coordinate updates until the
subproblem converges to numerical tolerance, yielding a minimizer in
\(\beta\) for the current \(W\).

\subsubsection{Normalization of W}

After each accepted \(W\) update, we normalize the columns of \(W\) as
\(W \leftarrow W D^{-1}\), and adjust \(H\) and \(\beta\) as \[
H \leftarrow D H, \qquad \beta \leftarrow D \beta,
\] where \(D\) is the diagonal matrix of column \(\ell_2\)-norms of
\(W\). This preserves the reconstruction \(WH\) and the linear predictor
\(W\beta\), leaving both the NMF and Cox terms in the loss unchanged.
Normalization prevents degeneracy in the scale-nonidentifiable
factorization and keeps columns of \(W\) comparable in magnitude and
interpretable as gene programs.

\subsubsection{Derivation of W update from projected coordinate descent}

The W update can be derived directly from the projected coordinate
descent update with a specific step size.

Recall that the overall loss function is \begin{align}
    \mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta) = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{2np} ||X - WH||^2_F - \frac{2 \alpha}{n_{event}} \ell(W,\beta) + \lambda(\xi||\beta||_1 + \frac{(1-\xi)}{2},
\end{align} where \(\ell(W,\beta)\) is the log-partial likelihood for
the Cox model. Let \(\nabla_W \ell\) represent the derivative of
\(\ell(W,\beta)\) with respect to \(W\). Then the derivative of the
overall loss with respect to \(W\) is

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial W} = \frac{(1-\alpha)}{np}\left( WHH^T - XH^T \right) - \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell
\end{equation}

Then the gradient descent update rule at iteration \(t\) is
\begin{align}
  W^{(t)} &= W^{(t-1)} - \gamma \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial W} \right) \nonumber \\
          &= W^{(t-1)} - \gamma \left( \frac{(1-\alpha)}{np}\left( WHH^T - XH^T \right) - \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell \right)\\
\end{align} Let the step size \(\gamma\) be defined as in CITE:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \frac{np}{(1-\alpha)}\frac{W}{WHH^T}
\end{equation} Then the update becomes \begin{align}
  W^{(t)} &= W^{(t-1)} -\frac{np}{(1-\alpha)}\frac{W}{WHH^T} \left( \frac{(1-\alpha)}{np}\left( WHH^T - XH^T \right) - \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell \right) \nonumber \\
          &= \frac{W}{WHH^T} XH^T + \frac{2\alpha np}{n_{event}(1-\alpha)} \nabla_W \ell \nonumber \\
          &= W \odot \frac{XH^T + \frac{2\alpha np}{n_{event}(1-\alpha)} \nabla_W \ell }{WHH^T} \nonumber \\
          &= W \odot \frac{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} XH^T + \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell}{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} WHH^T}
\end{align} Finally, projected coordinate descent projects the \(W\)
update in to the positive space \begin{equation}
  W^{(t)} =  \max \left(W \odot \frac{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} XH^T + \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell}{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np}WHH^T}, 0\right)
\end{equation} Since \(W \geq 0\) this is equivalent to \begin{equation}
  W^{(t)} =  W \odot \max \left( \frac{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} XH^T + \frac{2\alpha}{n_{event}} \nabla_W \ell}{\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np} WHH^T}, 0 \right)
\end{equation} which matches the multiplicative form used in the
software implementation.

\subsection{Convergence proof}

We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the block coordinate
descent (BCD) Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:desurv} converges to a
stationary point of the DeSurv loss function \[
\mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta).
\] For clarity, we first analyze the algorithm \emph{without} the column
normalization of \(W\) inside the loop, and then argue in
Section\textasciitilde{}\ref{subsec:conv_normalization} that the
normalization step preserves stationarity of limit points.

Throughout, let \(\theta = (W,H,\beta)\) and denote
\(\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathcal{L}(W,H,\beta)\). The feasible set is \[
\Theta = \{(W,H,\beta):
  W \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{p\times k},\;
  H \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{k\times n},\;
  \beta \in \mathbb{R}^k\}.
\]

\textbf{Assumption 1 (Regularity and parameter space).} We assume:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item The data $X \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{p\times n}$, $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\delta \in \{0,1\}^n$ are fixed and bounded.
  \item The hyperparameters satisfy $\lambda_H > 0$, $\lambda>0$, $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and $\xi \in [0,1]$.
  \item The initial iterate $\theta^{(0)} = (W^{(0)},H^{(0)},\beta^{(0)})$ lies in $\Theta$ and satisfies $W^{(0)},H^{(0)} > 0$ elementwise.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Assumption 2 (Block updates).} At each outer iteration \(t\),
the three block updates in Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:desurv}
satisfy:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item \emph{$H$-update.} For fixed $(W^{(t)},\beta^{(t)})$, the update
        $H^{(t)} \mapsto H^{(t+1)}$ is given by the multiplicative rule
        \[
        H \leftarrow H \odot \frac{W^\top X}{W^\top W H + \lambda_H H},
        \]
        applied at $(W^{(t)},H^{(t)})$. This rule preserves nonnegativity and
        yields a nonincreasing value of the reconstruction term conditional on
        $W^{(t)}$ and $\beta^{(t)}$; see e.g.
        [@seung2001algorithms; @pascualmontano2006nonsmooth; @lin2007convergence].
  \item \emph{$W$-update.} For fixed $(H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)})$, the update
        $W^{(t)} \mapsto W^{(t+1)}$ is the hybrid multiplicative step
        followed by backtracking as in Algorithm~S\ref{alg:backtrack}, producing
        $W^{(t+1)}$ such that
        \[
          \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)})
          \le
          \mathcal{L}(W^{(t)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)}).
        \]
        If no candidate satisfies the Armijo-type condition within the allowed
        number of backtracking steps, the algorithm sets
        $W^{(t+1)} := W^{(t)}$.
  \item \emph{$\beta$-update.} For fixed $(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)})$, the update
        $\beta^{(t)} \mapsto \beta^{(t+1)}$ is obtained by running the
        coordinate descent method of [@simon2011regularization] on the convex elastic-net Cox
        subproblem until convergence. Thus
        \[
          \beta^{(t+1)} \in
          \arg\min_{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^k}
          \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta),
        \]
        and
        \[
          \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t+1)})
          \le
          \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)}).
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Lemma 1 (Continuity and bounded level sets).} Under Assumption
1, \(\mathcal{L}:\Theta\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous, and the initial
sublevel set \[
  \mathcal{S}_0 := \{\theta \in \Theta:
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) \le \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(0)})\}
\] is nonempty, closed, and bounded.

\emph{Proof.} The NMF term \(\|X-WH\|_F^2\) is a polynomial in the
entries of \(W\) and \(H\), hence is continuously differentiable. The
penalty \(\|H\|_F^2\) is continuous as well. The Cox partial
log-likelihood is a smooth function of the linear predictor
\(\eta_i = x_i^\top W \beta\), which is linear in \((W,\beta)\), so this
term is continuously differentiable in \((W,\beta)\). The \(\ell_2\)
penalty on \(\beta\) is smooth, and the \(\ell_1\) penalty is convex and
lower semicontinuous. Therefore \(\mathcal{L}\) is continuous on
\(\Theta\).

The constraints \(W,H\ge 0\) define closed convex cones, and
\(\beta\in\mathbb{R}^k\) is unconstrained. Because \(\lambda_H>0\) and
\(\lambda>0\), the terms \(\tfrac{\lambda_H}{nk}\|H\|_F^2\) and
\(\lambda\tfrac{1-\xi}{2}\|\beta\|_2^2\) dominate the objective as
\(\|H\|_F\to\infty\) or \(\|\beta\|_2\to\infty\), respectively. Thus the
sublevel set \(\mathcal{S}_0\) is bounded in \((H,\beta)\). Since
\(W\ge 0\) and \(X\) is fixed, the reconstruction term and Cox term
being bounded prevent \(W\) from diverging while \(\mathcal{L}\) remains
below \(\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(0)})\), so \(W\) is bounded on
\(\mathcal{S}_0\). Because \(\Theta\) is closed and \(\mathcal{L}\) is
continuous, \(\mathcal{S}_0\) is closed. Nonemptiness follows from
\(\theta^{(0)}\in\mathcal{S}_0\). \hfill\(\square\)

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Lemma 2 (Monotone descent and existence of limit points).} Under
Assumptions 1 and 2, Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:desurv} (without
\(W\) normalization) generates a sequence
\(\{\theta^{(t)}\}_{t\ge 0}\subset\mathcal{S}_0\) such that \[
  \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t+1)}) \le \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\quad \forall\,t,
\] and \(\{\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\}\) converges to a finite limit
\(\mathcal{L}^*\). Moreover, \(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\) is bounded and
therefore admits at least one limit point.

\emph{Proof.} By Assumption 2(i), \[
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)})
  \le
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t)},H^{(t)},\beta^{(t)}).
\] By Assumption 2(ii), \[
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)})
  \le
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)}).
\] By Assumption 2(iii), \[
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t+1)})
  \le
  \mathcal{L}(W^{(t+1)},H^{(t+1)},\beta^{(t)}).
\] Combining these inequalities gives \[
  \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t+1)}) \le \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\quad\forall t,
\] so \(\{\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\}\) is monotonically nonincreasing.
Since \(\mathcal{L}\) is bounded below on \(\Theta\), the sequence
converges to some finite \(\mathcal{L}^*\).

Each iterate lies in \(\mathcal{S}_0\) by construction, and
\(\mathcal{S}_0\) is bounded by Lemma 1. Therefore \(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\)
is bounded and has at least one limit point by the Bolzano--Weierstrass
theorem. \hfill\(\square\)

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Lemma 3 (Blockwise optimality of limit points).} Let
\(\theta^*=(W^*,H^*,\beta^*)\) be any limit point of
\(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\) under Assumptions\textasciitilde1--2. Then:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $H^*$ satisfies the KKT conditions for
        \[
          \min_{H\ge 0} \mathcal{L}(W^*,H,\beta^*).
        \]
  \item $W^*$ satisfies the KKT conditions for
        \[
          \min_{W\ge 0} \mathcal{L}(W,H^*,\beta^*).
        \]
  \item $\beta^*$ is the unique minimizer of
        \[
          \min_{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^k} \mathcal{L}(W^*,H^*,\beta),
        \]
        and satisfies the KKT conditions for the elastic-net Cox subproblem.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof.} Let \(\{t_j\}\) be a subsequence such that
\(\theta^{(t_j)}\to\theta^*=(W^*,H^*,\beta^*)\). By continuity of
\(\mathcal{L}\), \(\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t_j)})\to\mathcal{L}^*\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\item
  Conditional on \((W,\beta)\), the \(H\)-subproblem is \begin{equation}
    \min_{H \geq 0}\frac{(1-\alpha)}{np}(\lVert X-WH \rVert_F^2 + \frac{\lambda_H}{nk}||H||_F^2) + \text{const in $H$},\nonumber
  \end{equation} a strictly convex quadratic program. The multiplicative
  update for \(H\) is known to be a descent method whose fixed points
  coincide with the KKT points of this constrained subproblem (19, 22).
  Since the full objective \(\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\) converges, the
  per-iteration decrease in \(\mathcal{L}\) due to the \(H\)-update must
  vanish along \(\{t_j\}\). If \(H^*\) were not KKT for the
  \(H\)-subproblem given \((W^*,\beta^*)\), there would exist a feasible
  descent direction for \(H\) at \((W^*,\beta^*)\), implying that for
  sufficiently large \(j\) the \(H\)-update would still produce a strict
  decrease in \(\mathcal{L}\), contradicting convergence. Hence \(H^*\)
  satisfies the KKT conditions.
\item
  Conditional on \((H,\beta)\), the \(W\)-subproblem is differentiable
  and convex in \(W\) (sum of a quadratic term and a negative Cox
  partial log-likelihood in a linear predictor). The hybrid
  multiplicative step with backtracking can be viewed as a projected
  gradient-like update onto the nonnegative orthant. Under mild
  conditions on the search direction and step sizes, any limit point of
  such a projected gradient scheme is a KKT point for the constrained
  subproblem; see, for example, (23, 24). If \(W^*\) did not satisfy the
  KKT conditions, there would be a feasible descent direction at
  \((W^*,H^*,\beta^*)\) and a sufficiently small step that reduces
  \(\mathcal{L}\), which the line search would eventually accept. This
  would contradict the fact that
  \(\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t_j)})\to\mathcal{L}^*\). Therefore \(W^*\) is
  KKT for the \(W\)-subproblem.
\item
  For fixed \((W,H)\), the \(\beta\)-subproblem is the convex
  elastic-net penalized Cox objective. The coordinate descent algorithm
  converges to the unique minimizer. By Assumption
  2(iii),\(\beta^{(t+1)}\) is taken to be this minimizer at each
  iteration. Passing to the limit along \(\{t_j\}\) shows that
  \(\beta^*\) is the unique minimizer of the \(\beta\)-block given
  \((W^*,H^*)\) and hence satisfies its KKT conditions.
  \hfill\(\square\)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Convergence to a stationary point).} Under
Assumptions 1 and 2, the sequence \(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\) produced by
Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:desurv} (without \(W\) normalization)
satisfies:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item The objective values $\{\mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\}$ are monotonically
        nonincreasing and converge to a finite limit $\mathcal{L}^*$.
  \item Every limit point $\theta^* = (W^*,H^*,\beta^*)$ of $\{\theta^{(t)}\}$
        is a stationary point of $\mathcal{L}$ on $\Theta$, i.e. it satisfies
        the first-order KKT conditions for
        \[
          \min_{\theta\in\Theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta).
        \]
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Proof.} Part (a) is Lemma 2. For part (b), Lemma 3 shows that any
limit point \(\theta^*\) is blockwise optimal: each block is optimal (in
the KKT sense) when the others are held fixed.

The DeSurv loss can be written as \[
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = f(W,H,\beta) + g(\beta)
                     + I_{\{W\ge 0\}}(W) + I_{\{H\ge 0\}}(H),
\] where \(f\) is continuously differentiable,
\(g(\beta)=\lambda\xi\|\beta\|_1\) is a separable convex (possibly
nondifferentiable) penalty, and \(I_C\) denotes the indicator of a
closed convex set \(C\). This is the smooth+nonsmooth composite form
considered in block coordinate descent analyses such as (23). In this
setting, any point that is optimal with respect to each block
individually (a block coordinatewise minimizer) is a stationary point
for the full problem: equivalently, \[
0 \in \nabla_{W,H} f(W^*,H^*,\beta^*)
    + \partial I_{\{W\ge 0\}}(W^*)
    + \partial I_{\{H\ge 0\}}(H^*),
\] \[
0 \in \nabla_\beta f(W^*,H^*,\beta^*)
    + \partial g(\beta^*),
\] which are precisely the KKT conditions for
\(\min_{\theta\in\Theta}\mathcal{L}(\theta)\). Hence every limit point
of Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:desurv} is stationary.
\hfill\(\square\)

\subsubsection{Effect of column normalization of $W$}
\label{subsec:conv_normalization}

The above analysis omits the column-normalization step for \(W\) used in
Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:backtrack}. We briefly argue that
this normalization does not affect stationarity of limit points.

Let \(D\) be a diagonal matrix with strictly positive diagonal entries.
The transformation \[
  (W,H,\beta) \mapsto (W',H',\beta') = (W D^{-1},\, D H,\, D\beta)
\] preserves both the product \(WH\) and the linear predictor
\(W\beta\), and hence leaves \(\mathcal{L}\) invariant. The
column-normalization step is exactly such a transformation, with \(D\)
chosen from the column norms of \(W\).

Let \(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\) be the sequence generated by the algorithm
without normalization, and let \(\{\tilde{\theta}^{(t)}\}\) be the
sequence with normalization. For each \(t\) there exists a diagonal
\(D^{(t)}\) with strictly positive entries such that \[
  \tilde{\theta}^{(t)} =
  (W^{(t)} D^{(t),-1},\, D^{(t)} H^{(t)},\, D^{(t)}\beta^{(t)}),
\] and
\(\mathcal{L}(\tilde{\theta}^{(t)}) = \mathcal{L}(\theta^{(t)})\). Thus
limit points of \(\{\tilde{\theta}^{(t)}\}\) are obtained from limit
points of \(\{\theta^{(t)}\}\) by such invertible diagonal scalings.

Since the KKT conditions are expressed in terms of the gradients with
respect to \(WH\) and \(W\beta\), and these quantities are invariant
under the above scaling, stationarity is preserved under the
transformation. Therefore Theorem\textasciitilde1 implies that every
limit point of the \emph{normalized} algorithm is also a stationary
point of \(\mathcal{L}\) (up to this scaling equivalence), which
establishes convergence of the implementation used in practice.

\subsubsection{Remark (Coxnet implementation)}

Our implementation updates the \(\beta\) block using a Coxnet-style
coordinate descent that relies on an approximate Hessian. Consequently,
the formal optimality proof is established for an idealized version of
the \(\beta\) update that assumes exact second-order information.
Nonetheless, in empirical applications the approximate update is
numerically stable and yields a monotone decrease in the objective,
consistent with the behavior predicted by the idealized analysis.

\subsection{Supervision on \(W\) versus \(H\)}

Classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is non-identifiable:
for any invertible matrix \(R\) with nonnegative entries, the
factorization \((W, H)\) can be transformed to \((W R, R^{-1} H)\)
without changing the reconstruction error, yielding multiple valid
solutions (25--27). Although normalizing columns of \(W\) or rows of
\(H\) resolves the trivial scaling ambiguity, nonnegative mixing
transformations persist, and empirical studies consistently show that
the sample-loading matrix \(H\) is more sensitive to initialization and
local minima than the program matrix \(W\) (28--30).

In DeSurv, survival supervision enters through the projection
\(Z = X^\top W\) in the partial log-likelihood, so that the gradient of
the DeSurv loss with respect to the programs is \[
\nabla \mathcal{L} = (1-\alpha) \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Cox}}(W,H) - \alpha\nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Cox}}(W,\beta),
\] and therefore the update rule for \(W\) as in
Equation\textasciitilde{}\ref{eqn:W_update} relies on both the
reconstruction term and the supervision term. As such, the gene-program
definitions are directly shaped by their association with survival. This
mechanism amplifies genes aligned with the hazard gradient and
suppresses those that dilute prognostic structure, ensuring that the
learned programs encode survival-relevant biological variation.

By contrast, if supervision were applied to the sample loadings \(H\),
the model could reduce the Cox loss by redistributing patient-specific
coefficients while leaving the gene-level programs \(W\) nearly
unchanged, a behavior documented in multiple supervised variants of NMF
and supervised topic models, where supervision applied only to the
coefficient matrix modifies \(H\) but not the basis \(W\) (31--33).

Supervising \(W\) also provides a practical advantage for
\textbf{portability}: because \(W\) defines gene-level programs, new
samples can be embedded by the closed-form projection
\(Z_{\text{new}} = X_{\text{new}}^\top W\). In contrast, supervising
\(H\) would not yield such a mapping; instead, obtaining sample loadings
for external datasets would require solving a nonnegative least-squares
(NNLS) problem for each new sample, introducing optimization noise and
reducing reproducibility.

Together, these considerations motivate supervising through \(W\), which
shapes the gene programs toward prognostic directions, stabilizes
solutions across initializations, and yields biologically interpretable
signatures that generalize across cohorts.

\subsection{Cross-validation procedure}

Algorithm\textasciitilde S\ref{alg:cv} describes the cross validation
procedure with \(F\) folds and \(R\) initializations. We define the
c-index using comparable pairs
\(\mathcal{P} = \{(i,j) : y_i < y_j,\ \delta_i = 1\}\) and linear
predictors \(\hat{\eta}_i\): \begin{equation}
\label{eqn:cindex}
\hat{c} =
\frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}|}
\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}}
\left[
  \mathbb{1}(\hat{\eta}_i > \hat{\eta}_j)
  + \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbb{1}(\hat{\eta}_i = \hat{\eta}_j)
\right].
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
